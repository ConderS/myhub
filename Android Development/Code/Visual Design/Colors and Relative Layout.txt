RelativeLayout 		- used when we want to place views relative to one another or relative to the edges 
			   of the layout


------------------Change Background of App--------------------

In the 'Design Tab', click on 'RelativeLayout' in the 'Component Tree' window.

Go to 'background' in properties.

Click on the three dots that show up when you select 'background'

a. Select color in the 'Color Tab' and choose a pre-selected color

	ALTERNATIVE:
	
b. Go to 'Add new resource' in upper right and select 'New color value' to get a pallette to create your own

	You can also enter the color code in the '#       ' box in that color pallette

	OR

Enter color code inside the space of the 'background' property field ITSELF


----Code---

Adding:

	 android:textColor="@android:color/white"


also works for some pre-defined colors (those that have been named by the Studio itself already)


UNIVERSALLY:

	android:background="#fff092b0" 

This works with color codes too


---------------------Button------------------

Can do the same thing EVEN THOUGH there appears to be text already in the 'background' field

-------------------TextView-----------------------

Select 'textColor' property field


------------------------------------DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS BASED ON DIFFERENT FACTS-------------------------------

We select colors, but change the TRANSPARENCY of the color of the object

We change the ALPHA value (A) (or 'FF')

	255 - Completely Opaque
	0     - Completely Transparent

We can change to '128' for about 50% transparency on the 'Did you know?' text
