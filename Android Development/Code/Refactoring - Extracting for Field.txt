
The goal of refactoring is to make the code more organized and adaptable WITHOUT changing how the code behaves. 


--------------------

1. Right click "facts"

2. Refactor

3. Extract

4. Field

5. In the pop up dropdown bar: choose 'field declaration'

6. BAM automatically sends 'facts' to field declaration, renames it to 'mFacts', and even declares it 'private final'


--------------------------

I wonder what else Refactor can do for us.

Keyboard shortcuts make tips and tricks like this even more efficient. 

Let's make sure we master it yeh?
