
1. Declare an instance variable with a data type of RelativeLayout.
    (Same format as other View fields)

2. Set this variable in the 'onCreate' method like other Views.

 	You may need to add an ID to the RelativeLayout in the Layout file

3. When we set a new fun fact, call the 'setBackgroundColor()' method on this new variable

	Use Color.Red as the parameter

--------------------------------------------------------------

In 'activity_fun_facts.xml', look at Relative Layout:

	android:id="@+id/relativeLayout"	//Add/change the relative layout id to what  you want


In FunFactsActivity.java:

 	private RelativeLayout mRelativeLayout;

 	mRelativeLayout = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.relativeLayout);	//after we give it an ID,
								   gotta look for it in the xml file
								   OR property pane
