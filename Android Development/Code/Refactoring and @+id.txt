android: id="@+id/textView"		- the 'textView' part is the actual ID we can use in the system


We use the ID to refer to these views from within our code.

This is also true for buttons, etc..

	android:"@+id/button"

Notice in other textViews, the ID code is:

	android:id="@+id/textView2"

-------------------

It's a good idea to make IDs more specific, and renaming it - like most other things, by doing a REFACTORING.

	We can't just change it within the code, cause if the widget is already referred to elsewhere, then we have 
	to change every instance of it, this is why we do a REFACTORING.


-----------------Refactoring--------------------------

The goal of refactoring is to make the code more organized and adaptable WITHOUT changing how the code behaves. 

We rename it in one place, and Android Studio takes care of it in EVERY OTHER REFERENCE to that ID

NOTE: Won't affect other classes with same variable name. 


Right Click on ID statement > Refactor > Rename (Don't change the '@+id/' part)

New ID statement:

	 android:id="@+id/factTextView"


Remember the naming convention: variables begin wth lowercase 'm'
