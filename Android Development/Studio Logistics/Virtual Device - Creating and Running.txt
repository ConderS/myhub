Go into AVD Manager.

Notice we can create our own virtual device, testing our app with a device not already included in the previous list.


-----Selecting a System Image-----

Represents which version of Android we want to have on our virtual device.

x86 is meant for computers. 
We can only utilize HAXM on x86.

In the tab - "Other Images":
	"arm" is meant for mobile platforms.

Targets that contain the phrase "Google APIs" mean that they contain the Google APIs - i.e. Google maps

Since we are using a computer to run the emulator, we choose the x86 system image. 

------Verify Configuration--------

Advanced settings has settings for cameras and network connections

---

If your app relies on a network connection, make sure to test it under various network conditions.

In Advanced Settings, you can set many different speeds and latencies to make testing much more comprehensive.

NOTE: Make sure the "Enable Keyboard input" box is CHECKED
	- Allows us to use our computer keyboard
