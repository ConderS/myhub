Compile the program by simply typing "javac [insert program name].java"  in the CUNIX terminal. 

Run it by entering "java [insert program name]"

There is no needed user input in any of the programs. 

Compiling and running the programs in the Eclipse IDE also works just as well.

NOTICE:

	It should be noted in Problem 3 that a Thread.sleep(100) command was placed in the program to obtain 
	better results, and 30 trials was run for each code fragment. As a result, the time it takes to run the program 
	will be up to a few seconds.
