Discussing the big-O running time of the enqueue and dequeue operation of my queue implementation. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

enqueue(AnyType elem)

	Here, all that this operation does is push a value into the stack "s1". In the MyStack class, this is simply
	a call of the "addLast()" method of the LinkedList class, which is a constant time operation. 
	
	This means that, ultimately, the big-O running time is O(1). 

dequeue()

	In this operation, everything is in O(1) time except for the while statement. While pushing, popping, and checking
	for emptiness are all constant time operations, the while statement causes the program to pop N elements
	from stack s1 and push them to stack s2. That is, to continue popping and pushing elements until stack s1 is empty. 

	Therefore, this method ultimately has a big-O running time of O(N), a linear running time.
