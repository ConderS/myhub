The running time for trees is O(log N) on average. 

Binary search tree:		
	
	A data structure consisting of the implementation of two library collections classes: 

		1. TreeSet
		2. TreeMap

A tree can be defined in several ways. 
	One way is to define it recursively.

----------------------------Strcuture and Terminology of Trees-----------------------------

A tree is a collection of nodes. 
	The initial one at the top is called the ROOT.
	
	Below it are zero or more nonempty SUBTREES
		
		Each of their roots are connected by a directed EDGE from the root
	
	The root of each subtree is called the CHILD of the root. 
	
	The root is the PARENT of each subtree root

A tree therefore, consists of N nodes, one of which is a ROOT, and N - 1 EDGES
	N-1 edges because each edge connects some node to its parent, and every node except
	the root has one parent

Nodes with NO CHILDREN are called LEAVES

Nodes with the SAME PARENT are called SIBLINGS.

GRANDPARENT and GRANDCHILD can be defined in the same way. 

---------

A PATH from node1 to nodeK is defined as a sequence of nodes from parent to child from n1, n2, ..... nk. 

The LENGTH of the path is the number of edges in this path. 
	There is a path of length 0 from every node to itself. 

The DEPTH of nodeI is the length of the unique path FROM THE ROOT to nodeI.
	The ROOT is at depth 0. 

The HEIGHT of nodeI is the length of the longest path from nodeI to a LEAF.

If there'a path from nI and n2, then node1 is an ANCESTOR of n2.
	n2 is a DESCENDANT of n1

If n1 is a PROPER ANCESTOR of n2, then n2 is a PROPER DESCENDANT of n1. 


----------------------------Implemenation of Trees------------------------------

One way to implement a tree is to have in each node, besides its data, a link
to each child of the node.

Keep the children of each node in a linked list of tree nodes 
	This avoids wasting space since the number of children can greatly vary and is not always known in advance

This means that a node will have a link to its next sibling AND its FIRST CHID (the first child will have links to the rest of the siblings)
	- LinkedList can still only be built one node at a time

---Applicationn----

A directory in the unix file system is just a file with a list of al its children.

A path name "usr/mark/book/ch1.r" are simply directories with parents and their children. 


-------------------Preorder Traversal-----------------

In a PREORDER TRAVERSAL, work at a node is performed BEFORE its children are processed.
	Ex: when something is execeuted for a node without first proceeding down to process the node's children

If there are N file names to be output, then the running time is O(N).


---------------PostOrder Traversal------------------

In a POSTORDER traversal, the work at a node is performed AFTER its children are evaluated

-------------------------DIFFERENCE Between Preorder and Postorder Traversal-------------------

Preorders start at root, and move their way downwards and execute actions on the node they're on as they traverse

Postorders start executing their actions at the very lowest child node, and move their way upwards as they go.
