

Weighted Path Length		- Each edge has a cost to traverse it

Unweighted Path Length		- Number of edges on the path, namely N - 1

Negative-Cost cycle		- A cycle in which the shortest paths are not defined 
					- The negative paths allow one to run ceasessly in a loop through certain vertices
					   that "technically" have the shortest path because the cost gets more negative


-----------Dijkstra's Algorithm-------

Refer to textbook for specifics.

Dijkstra's algorithm DOES NOT work in the presence of a negative edge (but no negative cost cycle)
