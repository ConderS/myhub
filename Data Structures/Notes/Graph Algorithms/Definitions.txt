

Graph, G = (V,E)		- Consists of a set of VERTICES, V, and a set of EDGES, E. 

	Each edge is a pair (v, w)

	Edges are sometimes referred to as ARCS


DIRECTED graph			- If the pair is ORDERED, then the graph is DIRECTED.	
				(One - way paths with arrow pointing in the corresponding direction)

UNDIRECTED graph			- Paths are two-way. 


Weight/cost			- The third component of an edge

Path				- A sequence of vertices

LENGTH of a path			- Number of EDGES on the path
				- A path from the vertex to itself would have a length 0 (no edges)

Loop				- Graph contains an edge from a vertex to itself (circular)
				- The graphs we consider will all be LOOPLESS

Simple path			- All vertices are distinct, except that the FIRST and LAST one COULD be the same

CYCLE in directed graph		- A path of length at least 1 such that the STARTING vertex and the ENDING vertex are the same
				- The cycle is simple if the path is simple

    "      in undirected graphs 		- Edges must be DISTINCT	


Directed graph is ACYCLIC 		- No cycles
          (DAG)

Undirected graph is CONNECTED 	- A path from every vertex to every other vertex

Directed graph is STRONGLY CONNECTED    - If it has ^ above property: A path from every vertex to every other vertex

Directed graph is WEAKLY CONNECTED	- The directed graph itself is NOT strongly connected, but the UNDIRECTED version WOULD be CONNECTED

COMPLETE graph			- An edge between every pair of vertices
