In Github:

	.gitignore			//Files added here are IGNORED by GIT. 
				//Like the id information from Firebase

You can use the "Make git repository" option when creating Xcode project to effectively "git init"

	- You can use Terminal to reach the same directory and execute git commands

Make a repository on GitHub.


git remote -v		// Shows all remote repositories

git remote add origin <paste the github repo SSH link>

git pull origin <branch>	//Brings the changes 

	- git pull origin master	//The default starting branch is called "master"

"pull" does "fetch" and then "merge" for us

	We could:
			git fetch origin master
			git merge origin master
		
	But that's two steps.


git push origin master	//Pushes changes to the remote repository named "origin" to the branch "master"


----------------Making a local repository first then connecting it to GitHub-------------

2. git remote add origin <ssh github repo code>

3. git push -u origin master


--------------------When Making Changes---------------
