Merge conflicts when developers change the SAME line of code

Git will insert >>>>>>>>> and <<<<<<<<<< to signify where the merge conflicts are,
	it will include TWO different versions of the code that conflicts

- Communicate with the other programmers. Choose one and delete the other

- Now sync it

Even if someone just "added" something to the same line - it still shows as a merge conflict. 
You can accept both.
