For constraints in respect to a certain object - ALL dimensions must be included in order  for ANY 
	of the constraints to work

	i.e.	'Full Name'
		
		In order for the leading and trailing constraints to work... it needed to all set the TOP space
		in respect to the divider, and then the BOTTOM space to something at the bottom (Text field: Enter 
			your name...)


NOTE: If you're missing a constraint, the element will be HIGHLIGHTED in RED
