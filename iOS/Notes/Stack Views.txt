Divide up elements into their own stack views.

Even if it's just one element, add them to a stack view in case you add more stuff later

Choose Horizontal/Vertical depending on what direction you think you'll be adding elements in the future

- Note: We selected all the stack views and made them into a SINGLE stack view

Stack views will always stretch their width and height to fill the screen
