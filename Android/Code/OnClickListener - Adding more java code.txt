
Now we're just adding regular java code to make sure the 'fact' variable gets a random fact each time the button is clicked.
We use the 'Random' class from the standard java library.


Ex:

import java.util.Random;

View.OnClickListener listener = new View.OnClickListener() {
                        @Override
                        public void onClick(View v) {

                               String[] facts = {
                                       "Ants stretch when they wake up in the morning.",
                                       "Ostriches can run faster than horses.",
                                       "Olympic gold medals are actually made mostly of silver.",
                                       "You are born with 300 bones; by the time you are an adult you will have 206.",
                                       "It takes about 8 minutes for light from the Sun to reach Earth.",
                                       "Some bamboo plants can grow almost a meter in just one day.",
                                       "The state of Florida is bigger than England.",
                                       "Some penguins can leap 2-3 meters out of the water.",
                                       "On average, it takes 66 days to form a new habit.",
                                       "Mammoths still walked the earth when the Great Pyramid was being built." };

                                // Randomly select a fact from array with random number generator

                                Random randomGenerator = new Random();
                                int randomNumber = randomGenerator.nextInt(facts.length);

                                String fact = facts[randomNumber];

                                // Update the screen with our dynamic fact
                                mFactTextView.setText(fact);
                        }
                };
