	Select 'Project' to go to ALL the files of the project


In the 'app' folder:
	
	You should NEVER need to change anything in the 'build' folder 
	
	'libs' contains any optional libraries of code we might need in our project

	'test' and 'androidTest' are used for different kinds of testing - we'll get into it later

	'main' has all the files that we'll be WORKING with

	
	Inside 'main':

		'java' has all our java files

		'res' = resources, everything we can see or hear in the app
			Contains the layout information of the app in the phone as well

		Inside 'res':

			Inside 'layout':
					'activityfunfacts.xml'

This xml file is for DESIGNING screen layouts
