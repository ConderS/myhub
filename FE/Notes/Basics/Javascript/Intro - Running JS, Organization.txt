One statement only runs after the statement before it is complete.

----script.js--------

alert("Hello from Treehouse");		

	- Alert command: Browser sends alert that displays the text passed as a parameter

document.write("<h1>Welcome to Javascript Basics</h1>");

	- DISPLAYS this text in the document according to the html tags (doesn't animate the 'writing')

	- Notice how the quotation marks simply CONTAIN the code/parameter/argument passed within and 
		NOTHING MORE?

alert("Thanks for visiting.");

	- This alert only pops up after the previous statements are completed (and when the user moves on from them)
		- I.E. User has to CLOSE the first alert in order for the rest of the statements to execute


----------------------------------------------

Javascript files can be wholly separate files or typed directly into HTML.

Usually we create a separate file, [insert-name].js

	This will ONLY contain Javascript


To LINK the Javascript file to HTML, we use:
		
	<script src = "scripts.js"></script>

	Equated to 'src' should be the javascript file location (i.e. "js/app.js")


To type DIRECTLY into html, use:

	<script>alert("Here's another message.");  </script>


**NOTE: The HTML executes the Javascript files along with the rest of the HTML/JS
	ACCORDING TO THE ORDER of when you call/code the file with the <SCRIPT> tags


	They're usually placed in the HEAD of the page RIGHT BEFORE the closing head tag '</head>'

	OR
		
	Within the body of the page, just before the closing body tag, '</body>' 
		This allows the webpage to load ALL HTML BEFORE loading the Javascript
