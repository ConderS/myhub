Class is similar to ID

	Difference:
		Can have MULTIPLES of the same class on the same page
	
	However, each ID must be unique and cannot be repeated on the same page.
	

Ex:

---In index.html-----

<nav>
          <ul>
	<li><a href="index.html" class="selected">Portfolio</a></li>


'selected' can be any name you choose to give it. 


---in main.css----

nav a.selected, nav a:hover {
  color: #32673F;
}


We used the PERIOD to select the class 

The 'hover' pseudoclass is for when the cursor is HOVERED over the links
