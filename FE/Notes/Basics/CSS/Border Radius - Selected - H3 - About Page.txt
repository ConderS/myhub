We're going to create a new file called 'about.html'

	Unlike our index file, we can call oither pages whatever we want (as long as they keep the .html extension)
  
Almost every other web server will recognize the 'index.html' as the HOMEPAGE.


------Translating the Selected State of Nav------

<nav>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="index.html">Portfolio</a></li>
            <li><a href="about.html" class="selected">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
          </ul>
</nav>


Notice that now 'class = "selected" ' is attached to the About page.


---------------------------Pre-CSS Basics---------------------------

------Adding Propic------

An image of both a WIDTH and HEIGHT of 200 pixels will work best.


 <section>
         <img src="img/nick.jpg" alt = "Photograph of Nick Pettit" class = "profile-photo">
 </section>


------Adding Paragraphs and Links----

<section>
         <img src="img/nick.jpg" alt = "Photograph of Nick Pettit" class = "profile-photo">
          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Hey, I'm not Nick Pettit.</p>
          <p>Don't follow me <a href="http://twitter.com/nickrp">
                      @conderS</a>.</p>
</section>


---------------------------Applying CSS--------------------------------

In main.css:

	.profile-photo {
	  display: block;
	  max-width: 150px;
	  margin: 0 auto 30px;
	  border-radius: 100%;
	}

Setting the display to BLOCK allows us to use AUTO MARGINS to CENTER the element on the page
	Also prevents it from being displayed in line with the text.
	We want it to actually take up space on the page, with a width and height.

	Technically we could let it be text, and then use 'text-align: center' BUT this won't give us the flexibility
	we'll need later on for the DESKTOP LAYOUT   

The CENTERING is then done by: 'margin: 0 auto 30px'

The BORDER RADIUS property allows us to add ROUNDED CORNERS to an element.
	You can use PIXELS, but here we use the PERCENT instead. 

	100% means our corners will be SO ROUND that our photo will be a CIRCLE, rather than a square. 


----h3------

We'll edit this in the GENERAL section because this H3 will be applied to OTHER PAGES later on.

h3 {
    margin: 0 0 1em 0;
}	 


This is basically an insurance policy to make sure 'About' is always separate from all the other elements

NOTE: Always make sure to manually reset margins that you don't manually implement yourself.
	This will allow you to avoid pushing other elements out of the way.
