--------------Optimizing Images for Mobile Website-----------

This 'gallery' will take up two columns on mobile


In main.css:

img {
   max-width: 100%;
}


Tells images to fill the width of the parent container. 

	If the container shrinks down in size, then the image will shrink down with it. 


------List-Style------

#gallery {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
}

List-style will remove any bullet points from a list.


-------------

#gallery li {
    float: left;
    width: 45%;
    margin: 2.5%;
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
    color: #bdc3c7;
}


Floating elements will make the images appear side by side. Other elements FLOAT around these elements
	(Footer would flow around these images as well when the webpage is shrunk unless properly formatted
		See: Styling Image Captions)

Each width of the image will only ever take up 45% of the TOTAL WIDTH of its PARENT ELEMENT.
	This causes the images to SHRINK and GROW as the WEBPAGE grows and shrinks
	The parent elements, because they are not set, DEFAULT to 100%

****NOTE****: A width of 45% means that the page will be able to fit TWO images side by side 
	                     (which makes up 90% of the total width)
                       And the 10% left over is used to CREATE SPACE between the images

To use that 10% space, we use the 'margin' property and set it to 2.5%.
	That means EACH image has a margin on EACH SIDE of 2.5%.
	
	Two images with 2.5% margins on each side = 2.5% * 4 = 10%

****NOTE****: We must MANUALLY use up that remaining space. 

Background color is given to our caption text underneath. 

The caption text itself is given a gray color that ONLY SHOWS, if the text is UNLINKED for some reason.
