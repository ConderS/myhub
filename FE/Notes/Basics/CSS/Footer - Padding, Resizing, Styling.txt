nav a {
	font-weight: 800;
	padding: 15px 10px;
}


Font-weight can be set to NORMAL or BOLD.

	It can also be set to a specific number

***Adding padding on ALL sides of our links: 
	Allowing our CLICKS to hit the links EASIER with a mouse or a touch screen device
	(Padding area = target area)

	This padding also applies to EACH text/area/space that has a link embedded in it
		(The navigation tabs are now spaced out)


---------Stying Footer-------

Making the social media icons less prominent

****NOTE****

	Creating the images at twice the size and resizing them downward using CSS
		allows the pixels to still be there for HIGH RES displays


In index.html:

	<a href="http://twitter.com/nickrp"><img src="img/twitter-wrap.png" alt="Twitter logo" 
		class="social-icon"></a>
	<a href="http://facebook.com/conshou"><img src="img/facebook-wrap.png" alt="Facebook Logo" 
		class="social-icon"></a>

Here we use classes.
	
	We could've also used: footer a {....} 


In main.css:

	.social-icon {
		width: 20px;
		height: 20px;
		margin: 0 5px;
	}

Width is set to 20pixels.
Height is set to 20 pixels.
	(The icons are originally 40 pixels, we resize them down to half the size)
Margin of 5 pixels on the LEFT and RIGHT (separation between the two icons)


We can also select the 'social-icon' class with:
	
	footer a img.social-icon {
		....
	}
