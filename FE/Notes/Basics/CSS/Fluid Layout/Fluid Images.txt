First rule for creating a fluid layout:

	1. Using relative units to define dimensions


We've been doing this from the start with 

img {
	max-width: 100%;
}


and also by defining our width with PERCENT rather than pixels.
	(Percent = relative units that change the width based on relative width of parent container)


Make sure all your nested elements are using PERCENTAGES to define their DIMENSIONS
