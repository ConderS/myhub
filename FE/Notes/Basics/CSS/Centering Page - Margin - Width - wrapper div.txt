#wrapper {
  max-width: 940px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

-----------------------------

max-width: 940px;	

	 - We want pixels no larger than 940 pixels across (but can be less)

	- Could have just used "width: 0 auto;"


margin: 0 auto;

	- Spacing around the element
	- This is shorthand that will set the margin on all four sides:
		
		1st value sets margin on TOP and BOTTOM element 
			(Normally we declare unit, but this is 0)
		2nd value fills in any space on the LEFT or RIGHT side of the element

			Ex:
				Take entire width of page.
				Subtract 940 pixels from the middle.
				The rest of space on left and right is AUTOMATICALLY filled in

			As a result, this CENTERS the contents inside of this div element

h2 {
...
    margin: -5px 0 0;
    ...
}

First value: Top
Second value: Left and Right
Third value: Bottom


Here, we're bringing elements closer together. 


----------------------Padding--------------------

Padding: 		spacing inside the element to give it a little space within its margins

When you adjust the browser window, the space (padding) beside the elements will ALWAYS remain as 5% 
	NO MATTER how small the browser window gets
	
	Ensures space within element no matter what size

Ex:
	  padding: 0 5%;
	

	
	1st value: TOP and BOTTOM (Zero padding top and bottom)
	
	2nd value: LEFT and RIGHT (5% padding to both sides of the element)
		- Five percent of the TOTAL WIDTH of the WRAPPER ELEMENT itself


----Padding-Top----

footer {
....
 padding-top: 50px;
....
}

Specificies that this is padding for the top.
