<style></style> 		- We can write CSS within these tags to change the visual presentation of the HTML

<style>

	h1 {			- "h1" is an ELEMENT SELECTOR. It tells the browser which HTML element we would like to apply our styling to
	       	color: blue;	- "color" is a PROPERTY. "blue" is a VALUE.	  
	}
</style>

----------------The Cascading Rule of CSS-----------------

<style>
	footer {			
		color: green;
	}
	footer {
		color: orange;	- This second and MORE RECENT color command overrules the first color command. 
	}				- Footer text is now orange. 
</style>
