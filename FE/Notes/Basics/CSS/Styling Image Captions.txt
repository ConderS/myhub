#gallery li a p {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 5%;
  font-size: 0.75em;
  color: #bdc3c7;
}


We select the element with ID 'gallery', which is the unordered list.

Inside the list we select the ORDERED LIST --> ANCHOR element --> Paragraph text (image captions)


Paragraph text automatically has margins, here we remove that and INSTEAD put PADDING around the image.
	It's better to use PADDING than MARGINS because margins still push elements when they're inside the 
	parent container. 

The color of the caption is now gray, linked or unlinked. 

Font size now relatively smaller. 


-------Adding on to footer CSS-----

Clearing the footer of any influence from the rest of these floating elements

footer {
 ...
    clear: both;
   ....
}


Now when we shrink the webpage, the footer stays where it is.
