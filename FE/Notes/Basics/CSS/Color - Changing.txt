<style></style> 		- We can write CSS within these tags to change the visual presentation of the HTML

<style>

	h1 {			- "h1" is an ELEMENT SELECTOR. It tells the browser which HTML element we would like to apply our styling to
	       	color: blue;	- "color" is a PROPERTY. "blue" is a VALUE.	  
	}
</style>

----------------The Cascading Rule of CSS-----------------

<style>
	footer {			
		color: green;
	}
	footer {
		color: orange;	- This second and MORE RECENT color command overrules the first color command. 
	}				- Footer text is now orange. 
</style>

-----------Changing background color------------------------

<style>
	nav {				- Selecting the navigation element instead of the footer now
		color: white;		
		background-color: orange;	- Changes background color to orange	
	}				
</style>

	- BUT PROBLEM - Selector Specificity- the browser specifically styles the anchor tags, the text with LINKS, 
		so we have to be EVEN MORE SPECIFIC

-------------Selector Specificity - Descendant Selector---------------------------

<style>
	nav a {					- Goes from "nav" to the "a" tag within the "nav" element 	
		color: white;				- the ' <a href = ...... > </a> ' tag
		background-color: orange;		- Now, it's also specifically ONLY the background of the anchor text that changes color. 
	}						- The rest of the navigation section of the webpage remains white
</style>

	- NOTICE that you can go straight from "nav" to "a" even though in the HTML code,
		there are "ul" and "li" tags in between them
