header {
  float: left;
  margin: 0 0 30px 0;
  padding: 5px 0 0 0;
  width: 100%;
}


For the four-value 'margin' and 'padding', think CLOCKWISE: Top - Right - Bottom - LEFT

The float will be useful for styling the DESKTOP layout later on. 

We remove the awkward white space at the top by setting the top margin to 0, while separating it from bottom elements.

We set top padding to 5px, giving it padding at the top

NOTE: A floated element does not have an explicit width anymore. 

	We must SPECIFICALLY say that we want this element to stretch across this ENTIRE page 
	
	Hence the 'width: 100%'


-------Styling Navigation-------

nav ul {
	list-style: none;
	margin: 0 10px;
	padding: 0;
}


Remove any list-styles just in case.

Margins of 10pixels on LEFT and RIGHT

Remove any padding.


---display----

nav li {
	display: inline-block;
}


Every element has a display property by default.

	It's set to either BLOCK or INLINE 

Block:
	Takes up space on the page
	Appears to push other things out of the way
	
	Ex: sections, divs, etc...

Inline:
	Mostly just text

	Ex: An anchor element doesn't push any lines of text or images away
		it appears in the SAME line as the rest of the text 

Inline block:
	 We can have inline block items SIDE by SIDE (like inline items) but they'll still have a WIDTH and HEIGHT

	Ex: nav, list items, etc..


Result: 	Our links are now in a neat row.
