1. Goal of website			          Ex: 1. To get work, to showcase arts and crafts, etc...

2. List out page elements needed		
					2. Image gallery
					    About page
					    Contact page
					    Header	(site wide header is called: Top Level Navigation)
					    Footer

3. Wire Framing
				    
	- A drawing technique used to create
	  the shapes and visual structure of
	  a website
	
	- Wire frame separately for computer and phone screens

Mobile Sites

	- Remember that mobile sites don't have
	  a lot room for too many columns, but 
	  they're great at scrolling

	- Stack information and pictures in one or two columns
		
	- Navigation bars and logos and titles should be comfortably tight together

Desktop sites

	- Can spread apart the logo tags and the navigation and the header

	- Three or so columns works now

	- Spread information and contact details more. 
	
	- Give page elements more room to breathe
