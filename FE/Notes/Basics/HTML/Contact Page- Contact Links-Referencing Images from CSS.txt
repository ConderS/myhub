Create 'contact.html'

------------------------

We create two sections:
	
	<section>
	</section>
	<section>	
	</section>

In desktop view, this will be a two-column layout. 

In mobile view, it will be a single column with simply two sections stacked on top of one another. 


-----------------------------

<section>
         <h3>General Information</h3>
         <p>I am a cow. Just gonna fill up some space here to show the formatting of the paragraph</p>
         <p>Another paragraph that has stuff written in it, which I'm gonna show by just typing some random stuff in.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Contact Details</h3>
        <ul class="contact-info">
          <li class="phone"></li>  
        </ul>
      </section>


We need to add classes to the ordered list (i.e. 'phone') to ADD ICONS later in our CSS


------------Adding Telephone Number---------------

<li class="phone"><a href="tel:345-3212">345-3212</a></li>  


We can use 'tel:' to let smart phones know that this is a telephone number it can dial. 


-----------Adding Email-----------------

<li class="mail"><a href="mailto:boom@example.com">boom@example.com</a></li>


We can use "mailto:" to let the browser know that this is an email address it can send mail to.  


-------------Adding Tweet Link-------------------

<li class="twitter"><a href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=nickrp">@nickrp</a></li> 


Upon being clicked, this link automatically directs the user to the page for writing tweets.

Make sure the SCREEN_NAME is changed to YOUR twitter username for the tweet to be directed at YOUR account.


-----------------------------------Styling with CSS--------------------------------

.contact-info {
    list-style: none;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 0.9em;
}


-----Referencing Images with CSS---------
	
.contact-info li.phone a {
  background-image: url('../img/phone.png');
}
  
.contact-info li.mail a {
  background-image: url('../img/mail.png');
}

.contact-info li.twitter a {
  background-image: url('../img/twitter.png');
}


To reach the 'img' folder, we have to use '..' to step OUT of the CSS directory and go to the img folder.


----

However: we need to add SPACING and POSITIONING to position our images properly to the left of the text


.contact-info a {
  display: block;
  min-height: 20px;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 20px 20px;
  padding: 0 0 0 30px;
  margin: 0 0 10px;
}


The images will take up space as a BLOCK.

A minimum height here.

Background images will ALWAYS REPEAT by DEFAULT. 
	(Repeating meaning that they will be duplicated and FILL UP the background of the text, like a WALLPAPER)
		But we want backgrounds to display only ONCE. 
		So we set it to 'no-repeat'

'background-size' resizes the images DOWN to keep them defined on high resolution displays

We put padding on the LEFT side because THAT'S where our images are going to go
	It will push the TEXT over to the RIGHT

Margin spacing on the bottom to separate the contact details a little.


NOTE: 
	Margin adds more space to the bottom in this case. 
	Without padding, the background images are LITERALLY BEHIND the text.
		Padding moves the text OVER to the right and the images are STILL in the background as
		they were, only NOW they are BEHIND THE PADDING

******
	Margin adds space on the "outside" of the element and pushes nearby elemetns away.
	Padding adds space on the "inside" of the element and makes space between the element's EDGE and its CONTENT
