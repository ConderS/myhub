---------------------Preparing Images for Use in Website--------------------

Make sure that in the IDE, you have a folder of the images already selected/included within the file path

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>Conder Shou | Developer</title>
	</head>
  
	<body>
		<header>	
			<a href="index.html">		
				<h1>Conder Shou</h1>		
				<h2>Developer</h2>

			<nav>				
				<ul>		
								
					<li><a href="index.html">Portfolio</a></li> 	
					<li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>

				</ul>
			</nav>
		</header>
		<section>					
			<ul>
				<li>
					<img src="img/numbers-01.jpg" alt="">	- The image element tells the browser where the image file is located
				</li>							- Requires "src" (source atribute) that contains the name of the image file
			</ul>									- "img/numbers-01.jpg" states "folder/full image name"
		</section>								- Requires "alt" (alternate attribute) that gives a brief text description of the visual when the image is somehow unavilable
		<footer>										- Like a search engine spider (which can't see visual images) or because the site visitor has disabled images in their browser, or because site visitor is impaired - using a screen reader that reads text out loud
												- Not necessary to fill in the alt attribute if we have a caption for the image (we'll add one soon)

----------------------Relative Path-----------------

<img src="img/numbers-01.jpg" alt="">

	- This is called a RELATIVE PATH.
	- It tells us where the image is located RELATIVE to the index.html file
	- Using a relative path makes it easier to upload our site to a web server later on

-----------------------Absolute Path-------------------------

<img src="http://example.com/img/numbers-01.jpg" alt="">
	
	- An absolute path gives the path to the image no matter where we are referring to the file from
