IMPORTANT: You must write your html page elements in the order you would like them to appear on the page

--------------------------------------------------------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>Conder Shou | Developer</title>
	</head>
  
	<body>
		<header>					- Different from "head" element, which was for the web browser to read meta data about the HTML document 
			<h1>Conder Shou</h1>			- The "header" element helps to structure the content. 
			<h2>Developer</h2>			- The second level headline element that appears SMALLER than the first level headline
		</header>
		<section>					- Sections break up a page into logical groupings of information
			<p>Portfolio will go here.</p>	- The paragraph element will contain text in sentence or paragraph form
		</section>
		<footer>					- Represents the bottom of a content area. The complement of the header element.
								- Like the header, information in the "footer" will be featured in every page. (Social media links, copyright info, etc..)
			<p>&copy; 2014 Conder Shou.</p>	- "&copy;" is an HTML entity that represents the copyright character (Google it when you need to know what the HTML entities are of certain characters)
		</footer>						- HTML entities usually follow the syntax of "&" + "name of symbol" + ";"
	</body>							
</html>
