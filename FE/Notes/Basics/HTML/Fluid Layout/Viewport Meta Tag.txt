Allows us to control size of the browser window on mobile devices so that instead of site visitors panning
	and zooming around the page, our layout will be locked at the size of the window.

Underneath: <link .... href = "css/responsive.css">

	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">


Initial-scale - Size in relation to the "device-width"

Do this for ALL HTML pages.


This allows the browswer to change itself to FIT the width of the browser window of the mobile device or desktop.

	THUS allowing our media queries to THEN take effect.



Remember, beginning the design of the website to accommodate MOBILE DEVICES FIRST allows EASY, QUICK adjustments
	for adopting the website for a desktop.
