	It's best to start by designing the mobile version of the website first, then go on to desktops, tablets, etc...

Three rules for a fluid layout:

	1. Fluid images - Using relative units to define their dimensions 
	2. Fluid grid
	3. Media queries - Allow page elements to be adjusted based on the width of the page
