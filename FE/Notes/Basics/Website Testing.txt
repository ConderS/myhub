-------Testing for Clarity in Color Contrast:-----

1. Take screenshot of website

2. Paste in image-editing tool:
	
	Make black and white. (Set 'Saturation' to 0)


If everything still looks clear and easily distinguishable, then you're good.

	Make sure you have strong contrast.


------Testing for Aesthetics--------


Flip screenshot UPSIDE-DOWN

Look for:
	Balance
	
	Aesthetics


-------Testing Design Issues-----

Blur the image so that you can JUST BARELY make out the text


Look for:

	Color saturation

	Balance (In general: physical arrangement of portfolio/website elements, color, etc..)


Adding in a SMALL amount of blur.

Look for:

	Legibility of text


---------Validating Code-----------

Use W3C validators:		


--Validating HTML----

validator.w3.org


Look for:
		Pass or Fail.

The small warnings are nothing to be concerned with. 

You might get errors for google fonts and their pipe "|" characters. This should be fine(?)

----Validating CSS------

jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/


Look for:
		Pass or Fail


-------------------Real Devices--------------------------

Definitely test on real devices if possible.


-------------------Testing on Various Types of Browsers---------

Browserstack.com

Use a free trial to test your website on VARIOUS BROWSERS

	(Firefox, Windows, chrome, Opera, etc....)

Use "Screenshots" to test A LOT at once

Or do one at a time

REMEMBER:
		No matter how hard you try it's almost impossible to make your website look EXACTLY THE SAME
		in every screen resolution/device/web browser

GOAL:		
		Get as close to perfection as possible while spending the least amount of effort to get there.
