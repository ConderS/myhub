A priority queue has at least two of the following operations:

	insert		- equivalent of enqueue
	
	deleteMin		- finds, returns, and removes the minimum element in the priority queue
			- equivalent of dequeue

Priority queues are also important in the implementation of GREEDY ALGORITHMS
	which operate by repeatedly finding a minimum


----------------------------------------Simple Implementations----------------------------------------------------

We could use:

		LinkedList:	- insertions at the front O(1); traversing list and deleting the minimum O(N)
		
				- We could SORT the list to make insertions expensive O(N) and deleteMins cheap O(1)

		Binary Search Tree:		- This gives us O(logN) average time for both operations
