
Second greedy strategy:

	1. Continually select the edges in order of smallest weight
	2. Accept an edge if it does not cause a cycle


--------------------------

Worst case running time:	O(|E| log|E|)

	Since, |E| = O(|V|^2)

Running time is actually:	O(|E| log|V|)


In practice, the algorithm is much faster than this time bound would indicate.
