Each algorithm we describe will:

	Interchangeable
	
	Passed into an array containing the elements
	
	Assume that all array positions contain data to be sorted
	
	Assume N is the number of elements passed to our sorting routines

	The objects being sorted are of type Comparable	(therefore we use "compareTo" method)
		Besides reference assignments, this is the only operation allowed on the
		input data. 

		This is called COMPARISON-BASED SORTING
