You apply a hash function to that data

You do some calculation to that data

You get a number, that's hopefully smaller than the data you put in, like a compression

If you have a good hash function, you hopefully have unique numbers coming out.

Because you're losing some data, you might have some collisions.

It's hard, hopefully impossible, to find what the initial value was, based on the value you got out

You put in a word

You get a number, 5325, that is meant to be unique from any of your other outputs.

You're given the function applied to the number.

You cannot use an inverse of the function, apply it to 5325, and then find what the word was that was inputted

It acts as a signature for the file.
