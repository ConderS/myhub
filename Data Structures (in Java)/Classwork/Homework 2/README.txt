-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SymbolBalancejava
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compile the program by simply typing "javac SymbolBalance.java"  in the CUNIX terminal without the quotation marks. 

In order to use this program to check for symbol balancing in other java files, run it as (without the brackets):
	
	java SymbolBalance [insert Java file name INCLUDING the extension]

In this case, the Test.java file is provided for testing. This test file has an imbalanced "/*" operator. 

Besides that, there is no other need for user input. 

Compiling and running the program in the Eclipse IDE also works just as well.

Program2.java
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compile the program simply by typing "javac Program2.java" in the CUNIX terminal without the quotation marks.

Run the program by entering "java Program2" without the quotation marks. 

There is no other need for user input.

Other test files may be run to test the TwoStackQueue.java program. Simply compile them in the same way
as one might do with Program2, with the title of the file replacing "Program2". 

If other test files are to be run, then ensure that TwoStackQueue.java, MyStack.java, and MyQueue.java are located
within the same directory.

The Eclipse IDE also works just as well with this code. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any other program not given an instruction for compiling and running are simply meant to aid the 
programs SymbolBalance.java and Program2.java. Those programs should be kept in the same folder as these two
programs.
