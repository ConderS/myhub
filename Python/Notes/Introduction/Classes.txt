---Class-----

- Classes define "templates or blueprints" for building objects

- Once a class is defined, any number of objects can be "constructed/instantiated"

- EVERYTHING in Python is an OBJECT

- ALL Python objects "live" in the heap

- Each object has a FIXED type, which can be accessed via the 'type' function

- NAMED Objects	- Objects with attributes

- Method		- Attribute holding a function object
		- Can access and modify the object attributes

- Class methods are invoked by functions, operators, and the "." syntax	(See List)
