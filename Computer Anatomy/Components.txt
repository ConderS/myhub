Computer program		- tells a computer, in extreme detail, the SEQUENCE of STEPS needed to fulfill a task

Hardware			- the physical computer and its PERIPHERAL devices
				(peripheral - things that are able to be attached to the computer, that aren't
					           actually a crucial part of the computer itself)

Peripheral devices		- a keyboard, mouse, speakers, etc..

Software			- the programs that the computer executes

Programming		- the act of designing and implementing computer programs

CPU (Central Processing Unit)		- Composed of transistors
				- Performs program control and data processing
					- Locates and executes the program instructions
					- Ex: arithmetic operations, fetching data from external memory,
						placing processed data into storage, etc....

-----Two Kinds of Storage---

Primary storage			- Made from electornic circuits that store data (if supplied with electricity)
	
Secondary storage			- usually a HARD DISK, provides slower and less expensive storage that 
					persists without electricity
				- Can retain information without power
