          NOTE: We don't use the * here for ngIf.

          IMPORTANT: This is the form that the element IS transformed into WITH the STAR

          THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES WITH THE STAR

      <!-- With custom properties in directives, we set to them in the same way that we do normally with custom properties.

      NOTE: To set a string, we actually input it with '' WITHIN the ""

      "" are like () parentheses waiting for the parameter you want to pass

      NOTE: Angular figures out on its own if the property we're binding to is of the directive or of the component

       -->

     <!--  <p appBetterHighlight 
      [defaultColor] = "'yellow'" 
      [highlightColor] = "'red'"

   <!--    Setting an alias for an input property to 'appBetterHighlight' results in [appBetterHighlight] --> 

   <!--  You can also omit the [] and '' if you are passing a string to a property. It's confusing so not recommended I think. -->

      <!-- ngSwitch
        
        [ngSwitch] = "value" sets value as the expression we are evaluating

        When the value is one of those outlined in the *ngSwitchCase, the element is displayed.

        If value doesn't align with anything, then it defaults to showing the element with the *ngSwitchDefault directive

        Like switch-case statements, but for *ngIf
       -->

      <div [ngSwitch] = "value">
        <p *ngSwitchCase="5">Value is 5</p>
        <p *ngSwitchCase="10">Value is 10</p>
