Easy to remove elements from an array list by just calling the "remove" method

It's common, however, to remove ALL elements that MATCH a PARTICULAR CONDITION

For example, if we want to remove all strings of length < 4 from an array list:

	ArrayList<String> words = .....;
	
	for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++)
	{
		String word = words.get(i);
		
		if (word.length() < 4)
		{
			Remove the element at index i
		}
	}

HOWEVER, because the "remove" method MOVES all the elements after the position of the removed element DOWN,
	the increment of "i" in this for loop causes us to SKIP PAST the NEXT ELEMENT 
		(this element is in the position of the element just removed)


--------------------------------SOLLUTION------------------------------

THEREFORE, USE A WHILE LOOP:

	int i = 0;
	
	while ( i < words.size())
	{
		String word = words.get(i);
	
		if (word.length() < 4)
		{
			words.remove(i);
		}
		else
		{
			i++;
		}
	}
