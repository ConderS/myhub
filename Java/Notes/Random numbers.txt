The "Random" class of the Java library implements a random number generator that produces pseudo-random numbers.

These are some of its methods:

nextInt(n)		- A random integer between the integers 0 (inclusive) and n (exclusive)

nextDouble()	- A random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive)


import java.util.Random;
....

Random generator = new Random();		
int d = 1 + generator.nextInt(6);		- Simulates a roll of a die

....


Math.random() = a double value greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0 (meaning, excluding 1.0)


--------Flipping a Coin-----------------

public void flip()
{
	face = (int) (Math.random() * 2);	- converts a random number into integer between 0 and 2 (2 not inclusive) 
}						- the integer conversion rounds the number down - BECAUSE 2 IS NOT INCLUDED In the final range,
							it will always ROUND DOWN TO 1 as the HIGHEST.
					OFFICIAL RANGE: 0 to 1.
