			result[0]++;					because result[1] doesn't change, it gets carried back through the loop as the result[0] is increased for every time the dividend subtracted the divisor. 
			return result;						Then, the initial loop of "result" finishes and we have result[0] containing the quotient from all the times added, and result[1] containing the remainder

Prints:

	Quotient: 4 Remainder: 1
