----------------------------------------------------------------Comments------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comments are text included in the code that is not executed by the program.
They are meant for the developer (when it's been a while) and other onlooking programmers so that they 
	understand the functions of the code and how to use it.

----Purposes----

1. Code description - summarizing the purpose of a segment of code
2. Algorithm description 
3. Comment out a code segment that is not working properly
4. Automatic generation of documentation (Javadoc)

------------------------------Normal Commentary----------------------

----Single line comments-----

// This is a single line comment in Java	- Two forward slashes before the text of the comment for single-lined comments
					- Everything after the two forward slashes will be considered a comment until the end of the line
Ex:

	int a = 1;    // This is an int initialized to 1		
	int b = a*a;   // This line calculates the square of a

-------Multiple line Comments------

/* This is a multiple			- Start the comment with "/* " and end the comment with " */"
     line comment in Java */			- Can be used for both single and multiple line comments

/* The following code calculates
the square of a */

int a = 1;
int b = a*a;

---------------Stylistic Recommendations------------------

Multiple line comments are used for commenting blocks of code.

Single line comments are for everything else (single lines of code, etc..).

Don't over comment. Try to make every comment count.

If your code is bad, rewrite it rather than overcommenting.
