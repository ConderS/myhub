To change color, you must supply an object of type Color.java
		
This uses the RGB color model, specify color by amounts of primary colors - red, green, and blue

Amount is represented by integers between 0 (primary color not present) and 255 (maximum amount present)

Ex:

	Color magenta = new Color(255, 0, 255);	- Maximum red, no green, maximum blue
	
-------

For our convenience, a variety of colors have already been pre-defined:

	Color.PINK		(the same as: new Color(255, 175, 175))


--------------Drawing shapes in color------------

First set the color of the Graphics2D object, then call the draw method:

g2.setColor( Color.Red );
g2.draw(circle);   	// Draws the shape in red

-----------Coloring inside the shape----------

Use the fill method:

	g2.fill(circle);
