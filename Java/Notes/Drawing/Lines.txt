Either use constructor to specify two end points:

	Line2D.Double segment = new Line2D.Double(x1, y1, x2, y2);

Or, specify each end points as an object of the Point2D.Double class:

	Point2D.Double from = new Point2D.Double(x1, y1);
	Point2D.Double to = new Point2D.Double(x2, y2);
	Line2D.Double segment = new Line2D.Double(from, to);
