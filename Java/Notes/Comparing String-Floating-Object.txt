sqrt(2) *sqrt(2) - 2 does not precisely equal zero in the system.

Instead, we test whether they are close enough.

The threshold value is often called epsilon, commonly set to 10^-14

Test the program:

	final double EPSILON = 1E-14;
	if (Math.abs(x-y) <= EPSILON)
	{
		// x is appoximately equal to y
	}

-------------------Comparing Strings------------------

if (string1.equals(string2)) .....		- You must use this instead of "==" (the == tests if the strings are in the same memory location, which is useless for this)

string1.compareTo(string2) < 0 			- compares lexographically
				- If this condition is true, then string1 comes before string2 in the dictionary, alphabetically

	If string1.compareTo(string2) > 0, then string1 comes after string2. 

	If string1.compareTo(string2) == 0, then string1 and string2 are equal.

In Java, alphabetical means:

	Uppercase comes before lowercase: "Z" comes before "a"
	Space character comes before all printable characters
	Numbers come before letters
	Check online to see ordering of punctuation marks

----------------Comparing Objects-----------------------

Rectangle box1 = new Rectangle(5, 10, 20, 30);
Rectangle box2 = box1;
Rectangle box3 = new Rectangle(5, 10, 20, 30);

box1 == box2 is true.
HOWEVER, box1 == box3 IS NOT TRUE, because these are still DIFFERENT OBJECTS, even though they have the SAME PROPERTIES. 

box1.equals(box3)		- This tests if the CONTENTS of the objects are the same

---------------Equals Method In General----------

Be careful when using it.

Each class has its own implementation of the equals method.

For our own classes, we must supply our own appropriate "equals" method

-------------------null---------------------

An object reference have the special value "null" if it refers to no object at all or if a value has not been set.

	String middleInitial = null;

Use the "==" operator to test for null

if (middleInitial == null) 
{
	...
}

NOTICE: a null reference is NOT THE SAME as an empty string ""
	- An empty string has a valid length of 0
	- Null indicates that a string variable refers to NO STRING AT ALL
