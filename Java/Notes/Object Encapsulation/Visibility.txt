class Car {

	int gas; // from 0 to 100
	
	...

	void move (int n) {...; gas-=n; ...;}
	void fill (int n) {...; gas+=n; ...;}
}

	- The two methods "move" and "fill" are not in sole control of this variable. 
	   We must restrict this access somehow. 

------Access modifiers-----------

public 

private

Ex:

	class Car {

		private int gas;	 	- We can only access this variable WITHIN the class NOT OUTSIDE

		...
	
		public void move(int n) {...; gas-=n; ...;}		- Can be called from OUTSIDE the class
		public void fill(int n) {....; gas+=n; ....;}
	
		}

It is normal and typical to have private variables and public methods.

Ex:
	public class Car {					- Good to put "public" in front of Class
			private int gas;
			...
			public Car () {gas = 0;}
			public void move (int n) {...; gas-=n; check();}
			public void fill(int n) {....; gas += n; check();}
	
			private void check()		- AUXILLARY METHODS: Used for other public methods (Can't be used outside of class - ONLY for within)
				{if (gas<0) gas = 0; if (gas>100) gas = 100;}
