State = the values of the variables/attributes/fields at a given time
Method = the way in which the state changes/transforms. 
	- "Eating" changes the isHungry state of a hiker from true to false
	- Methods are often related to verbs because they imply an action
	- The methods at a given time are called "behavior"

Behavior = things that the object can do

All of these things are encapsulated into "objects".
