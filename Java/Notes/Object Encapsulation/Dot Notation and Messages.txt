	When you have defined a reference for the object (created an object and given it a name)
		you refer to the attribute through dot notation.

t.n1 		- Refers to attribute "n1" of object "t"

t.get1()		- Calls method "get1()" for "object t"

NOT get1(t)	- This applies to OTHER programming paradigms
