In an interface, all the methods are abstract. 
	UNLESS they are STATIC or DEFAULT

public interface VehicleIF {

	void moveForward();
	void moveBackward();
	String toString();
	static void goHome() {...}		- This is only a RECENT update. 
						Essentially, the interface is ENTIRELY ABSTRACT.
}

         In an interface, ALL methods are PUBLIC and ABSTRACT, same thing as:

	public abstract void moveForward();
	public abstract void moveBackward();
	public abstract String toString();
	public static void goHome() {...};

There can also be attributes in an interface:
	Attributes are automatically PUBLIC, STATIC and FINAL

	public interface VehicleIF {
		int SOS_PHONE = 112;	- This attribute is automatically PUBLIC, STATIC and FINAL (hence the capitalization)	
						This means they are set constants. 
		void moveForward();
		void moveBackward();
		String toString();
	}
