Application Programming Interaces are:
	A set of tools and methods geared towards some ulterior function
	Programmed by others
	Available in the form of a library

Ex:
	The Java library includes a class called "Math" that contain several methods for performing
		mathematical operations, like the square root - Math.sqrt
	You can simply use the method and input the parameters, and the library will give you the output.
		Someone has already programmed the algorithms you would need for this operation.

Look into the library's documentation for the different methods provided in the API and their functions/descriptions.
