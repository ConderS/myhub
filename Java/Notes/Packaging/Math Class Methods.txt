Math.pow(3, 2) ---> 9
	
	Equivalent to 3^2

Math.abs(-3.5) ----> 3.5

Math.random() gives a random number between 0 and 1, inclusive, and INCLUDES DECIMALS.

	REFACTORING: In order to get a random number within the range of 0 and 10, you must MULTIPLY by 10
				Math.random() * 10

	To generate random numbers between a minimum value "x" and a maximum value "i"
		multiply the output of random with the difference between the maximum value "i" and the minimum value "x"
			and then add the minimum value "x"
	Ex:	
		Math.random() * (max - min) + min

Math.sqrt()

-------------

Ex:

public class Pythagoras {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
   
      double base = 10;
      double height = 15;
      double hypotenuse = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(base, 2) 
                        + Math.pow(height, 2));
      System.out.println(hypotenuse);
   }
}

Ex:

Which API call returns a random number greater than or equal to 10.0 and less than 100.0?

90.0 * Math.random() + 10.0
