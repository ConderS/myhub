The Java compiler generates the bytecode from the Java source code (source code = what you type).

The Java Virtual Machine translates this bytecode into the machine language that the computer can then run

Running the program = interpreting sentences individually to generate the output as it goes

"Interpretation" = execution

"Translation" = compilation
