!= 	- not equals to ( Matlab has ~= )

>=	- left side is "greater than or equal to" right side (MATLAB doesn't have this)

%	Modulus operator - Divides the left hand operand by the right hand operand and returns remainder

	Ex:
		int n = 5;
		System.out.println(n + 8/2);
			
			Prints: 9

		System.out.println(n % 6);

			Prints: 5		(it's 0 with remainder 5 - no decimas)

x = 8/3	Integer divider	
			Prints: 2 

	Ex:

		for (int i = 10; i> 0; i=i/3)
		
			- Here the loop runs 3 times. Because 10/3 equals 3. And 1/3 equals 0.
				(integer division)

!(x < 5 || 10 < x)  	Same thing as 	(5 <= x && x <= 10)
	
	- the not operator changes the "or" operator to "and" 
	
	- NOTICE: Even with the || or && operators, the entire argument must be within ONE set of parentheses)

++	increases the value of the operand by 1

--	decreases the value of the operand by 1

x += 1	increment x by 1 (x = x + 1)
	
	x += 2 --> increment x by 2

x -= 2	decremented by 2 (works in same way as increment operator)
	
	*=
	/=
	%=

-------------------
++x; 	increments x only by 1

	- Increments x first then shows the value of x

x++;	increments x only by 1

	- Shows the value of x first THEN increments by one

Works the same way with -- (minus minus) except it's for decrements

x = 3;
y = ++x;
z = x++;

	- "y" equals 4
	- HOWEVER, "z" also equals 4 even though "x" equals 5

This doesn't impact: if (x++==4) .... 	- The if statement is still considering a variable "x" equal to 0 whether or not it's ++x or x++
