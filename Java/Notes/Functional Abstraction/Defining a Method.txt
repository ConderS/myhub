Method = means "function" in JAVA terminology

int square (int x)		- Initialize the type of output that will be given by the method
			   The name given to the method,
			   Then the type of parameter and a variable name for it (the things in parentheses)
				- The name of the parameter does NOT interfere with the same variable name given outside the method declaration
int square (int x)
{			- Within curly brackets, the computation(s) of the function
	return x*x;	- "return" means that the result of the expression on the right will be the output of the method

}

---------------

There is a problem with this code.

double square(double x) {		- ERROR: There is no return value if the argument is less than zero 
	if (x >= 0) {				- Make sure you have return values for all possible outcomes
		return x*x;
	}
}

------Naming methods------

Recommendations (stylistic conventions):

	- the first letter should be lowercase
	- a verb of what the method does
	- it should have meaning
	- Capitalize the following words if the name needs more than one word

      Ex: 
	Verb: move
	Phrase: isEmpty
