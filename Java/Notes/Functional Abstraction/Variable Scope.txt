------------Variable Scope---------------------

int x = 1;			- This "x" is a GLOBAL VARIABLE (used everywhere in the code except for within methods)
int f(int x)		- This "x" is a LOCAL VARIABLE (it is only used by this method and does not affect anything outisde the method)
{
	return x+x;
}
int z = f(f(x+1));

--------

int x = 1;			- Same concept, except parameter is defined within body, not within declaration
int f()
{
	int x =2;
	return x+x;
}
int z = f();

------Using Outside Variable within body of method-----------

To use an outside variable in the body of the method, choose a DIFFERENT name for the parameter

int x = 1;
int f(int y)
{
	return x+y;
}
int z = f(x+1);

-------------------

int x = 1;
int f()
{
	int y = 2;		- Same concept as previous example, execept parameter is defined within body, not in declaration
	return x+y;
}
int z = f();
