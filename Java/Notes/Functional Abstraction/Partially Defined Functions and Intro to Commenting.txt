---------------------Defining partially defined functions------------------------

1. Expect an error
2. Comment the program so the programmer remembers how to use the function correctly
3. Prepare useful documentation (special comments for Javadoc)
4. Programming Exceptions so that the program can respond to the undefined cases (where there are no values of Y for some values X)

------Normal Commentary--------

Ex:
	double sqrt (int x) {

	/* x has to be 
	non-negative */		- Writing comments in JAVA (can do multiple lines as long as we end in "*/" ) 
	
		return ...;
	}


-------Special Commentary for Javadoc----

Ex:
	double sqrt (int x) {
	/**					- Javadoc takes these special comments and 
	  *  @param x an int value			  outputs a nicely formatted documentation for programmers to use
	  *	Precondition: x >= 0
	  *  @return the non-neg. sq. root		- @param and @return have special meanings that Javadoc uses to produce the resulting documentation
	  */					   (?? this lecture didn't tell me what these meanings were)
	    return ...;					
	}

-------Exceptions-------------------

Ex:
	double sqrt (int x) throws NegEx{		- Programming what to do for values that are not defined
	   if (x<0)  {throw new NegEx();}			(Refer to relevant notes on writing Exceptions)
	   return ..;
	}
