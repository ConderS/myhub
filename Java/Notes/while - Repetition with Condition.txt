------------------WHILE----------------

m = 7;
n = 2;

int x=m;
int y = 0;

while (x>=n) {		- Typical 'while' statement stuff
      x = x - n;
      y = y + 1;
}

----------------------Using input value----------

Keep a running total, a variable to which you add each input value. Of course, the total should be initialized with 0.

double total = 0;
while (in.hasNextDouble())		- user inputs a value each time
{
double input = in.nextDouble();
total = total + input;
}


double input = in.nextDouble();
while (in.hasNextDouble())
{
double previous = input;				
input = in.nextDouble();		- NOTICE: the .nextDouble() is placed after "double previous = input" so that the input can be compared with previously inputted value
if (input == previous)
{
System.out.println("Duplicate input");
}
}
