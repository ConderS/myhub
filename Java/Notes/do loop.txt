Sometimes you want to execute the body of a loop at least once and perform the loop test AFTER the body is executed. 

The do loop serves that purpose:

	do
	{
		statements
	}
	while (condition);

The body of the do loop is executed first, then the condition is tested.

Do loops are most commonly used for input validation.

Ex:

	int value;
	do 
	{
		System.out.print("Enter an integer < 100: ");
		value = in.nextInt();
	}
	while (value >= 100);

Basically, the do loop is a post-test loop, where the body is executed first, and the condition is tested after, 
and as long as the condition is true, the body will continue to be executed (and then tested afterwards).
