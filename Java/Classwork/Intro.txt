Linear Search: (also called sequential search)
 
Algorithm to determine whether a given name "x" appears on a list

Input: A list of n >= 1 names A[1], A[2], ... , A[n], and a given name "x"

Output: The message "Sorry, x is not on the list" if "x" is not on the list.

Otherwise, the message: "x occurs at position i on the list."
