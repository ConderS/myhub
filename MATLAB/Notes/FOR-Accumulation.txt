---Accumulation----

accumulator=0 - initialize a variable called the accumulator
			-usually set to zero

accumulator = accumulator + newValue

		- Each time through the loop compute a new quantity and add it to the current value of the accumulator,
		storing the result back in the accumulator

-----Series--------

N=100;

S=0;         -accumulator

for k=1:N
    S=S+k;   -adding values onto the accumulator (adds 1 with 2, then 1+2 with 3, then 1+2+3 to 4, etc..., eventually reaches to the addition of all the integers)
end

clc
disp(['Sum of the first ', num2str(N), ...
	'integers is ', num2str(S)]);

Output: Sum of the first 100 integers is 5050. 

-----Geometric Sum-------

N=5;
a=1/3;

S=0;
for k=0:N
    S = S + a^k;
end
			-Geometric series sum of (1/3)^k to five terms
