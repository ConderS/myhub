M=[1,2,3;4,5,6] Creates array

M(1,2) = 2 - Row 1 column 2 holds 2

V=[5,4,3,4,7,6] - Vector is one row or one column array

V(1)=5 - The number in the parentheses specifies what element of the array 

vc=V' - Apostrophe makes the vector into the opposite organization (from row vector to column vector, or vice versa)          

vc =
3
4
5
6

arrayA(:, 2) - Display all values in the 2nd column, all rows - colon ':' function means all values
	       and it's located in either the row or column value slot

arrayA(3, :) - Display all values in the 3rd row, all columns 

arrayA(3, 1) = 0 - Sets the specified element (Row 3 column 1) to 0--can set it equal to almost anything else

arrayB=arrayA(2:3, 1:2) - Only Rows 2 to 3 and Columns 1 to 2 of array A are selected for array B
------------------------------------------------------------------

u=3*V  - Multiplies each vector component by 3 ---Division, Multiplication, Subtraction, Addition of Vectors (w=u+v)

w=u+v - Only add vectors of same size


--Period here is an element by element function

w=u.*v - Multiplies vector element by element

w=u./v - Divides vector element by element

3./v - Divides 3 by each element of the vector

2.^v - Raises 2 to the power of each element of the vector

u=v1.*v2  - v1 and v2 must be the same size ---Division


--Not element by element

v1*v2 - Regular matrix multiplication

--Outer/Inner product
v=[1; 2; 3];
w=[4; 5; 6];
y=v'*w - Inner product (a scalar value, which is 32 here) Row vector * column vector

y=v*w' - Outer product (matrix)

y=[u, v] - Combines list of u and v. Starting with u. (Vice versa if it was y=[v,u])


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

w=zeros(1,5) - Creates a 1 row 5 column vector array of just zeros
 =ones(

x=linspace(0, 2, 12) - Creates an array of 12 columns that have equally spaced vaues between 0 and 2

u=[4, 5, 6]
length(u)=3 - Gives number of values in array; also used for number of characters in a string

min(u) = 4 - Gives minimum number in element
max(u) = 6 - Max
sum(u) = 15  - Sum

norm(u) - Square root of the sum of the squares of elements in u (Like calculating magnitude of vector)

cross(a,b) - Cross product of vectors a and b
dot(a,b) - Dot product of vectors a and b

rand(nr, nc) - Array with 'nr' rows and 'nc' columns populated with random values between 0 and 1
randi([a,b],nr,nc) - Array with 'nr' rows and 'nc' columns populated with random INTEGERS between [a,b] inclusive
randi(a,nr,nc) - Array with such rows with random integers between 1 and 'a' inclusive

rng('shuffle') - Resets random number generator
