-----Debugging MATLAB functions------

Cannot run function without argument by pressing green save-and-run button


1. Execute from command line with specific arguments:

	gauss(0, 0, 0.25)

To see if it correlates with the right value


2. Run simple function in outside program
	-Plotting, calculating some number, etc…

3. Modify run button
	-Click on bottom arrow on Green Run-and-Save button
	-Enter the inputs of function 
		-Ex: gauss(0, 0, 0.5)

	-To remove this function, right click the run-and-save option and press delete

-----------------
Can have several functions in one file

1st function must have same name as file (primary function)
	-Other functions are called subfunctions

Other functions must still have function declaration (but don’t have to have an end associated with them)

Subfunctions can only be executed by another function in the file (whether it be primary function or some other sub function)

---------
Keep functions organized in same folder

DO NOT USE “ADD TO PATH”
