MATLAB interprets 0 as false and a 1 (or any other nonzero number) as true
MATLAB interprets expressions "true" and false" as representing logical values
 
T=95
isTooHot = T>90  - Stores value 1, because it's true (stores value 0 if false)

isTooHot = true - Stores value 1
isTooHot = false - Stores value 0 
		


(a>0) && (a<=100) - a is greater than zero AND a is less than or equal to 100

year ~= 1960 	  - year is NOT EQUAL to 1960

~ 	- means NOT 

(Tc>Tmin) || (alpha>alphaMax) - Tc is greater than Tmin OR alpha is greater than alphaMax

----Comparing Strings-----

if strcmp(str1, str2) - Checks to see if two strings match each other:
					-If matching, then it stores value 1
					-If not matching, then it stores value 0
if strcmp(str1, str2)==false     - Can do this to have the if statement work when strcmp is false
					-Can also do ' if strcmp(str1, str2) == 0 '
						- '==1' for substitution of 'true'

strcmpi('Hello', 'heLLo') - Ignores the case of letters
				-Output is true here

----Switch Statements---------

switch <switchExpression>      -switchExpression can be a variable with a value assigned to it 
					-Ex: switch iDoor (where iDoor=randi(4))
  case <case1_exp>				case 1
	<statement block1>				disp('It''s a new car!');
  case <case2_exp>				case {2, 3} - the integer 2 OR 3 will BOTH match up with this case
	<statement block2>				disp('It''s a picture of someone else''s car!');
  case <case3_exp>				...
	<statement block3>
   ...
otherwise					otherwise
  	<default statement block>			disp('Something has gone wrong.')
end						end

		
	-If switchExpression==caseN_exp then <statement blockN> is executed.
		 Otherwise <default statement block> is executed
