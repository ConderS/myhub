----Functions with multiple returns---------

Syntax: [var1, var2, … ] = funcName(x1, x2, x3, …);

After var1, other returned variables are optional, but they must occur in the prescribed order.

Each input or output variable can be any MATLAB data structure
-Ex: double, string, vector, matrix, other 

Specify in header comments what each input and output represent

>> help myfun		prints header comments


If user calls function with just one variable on left, then only one function is returned.
	-The more variables asked on left, the more returned,
	 AS LONG AS function is defined to have that many inputs (x1, x2, x3, etc…)

Function [thetad, r] = function cart2pold(x, y)

r = sqrt(x.^2 + y.^2);
thetad = atan2d(y,x);
