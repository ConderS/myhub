--------Placing Images on an Axis----------

---------STEPS TO PLACING FIGURE ON AN AXIS----------------

1. Read figure from file with imread
2. Flip color planes to Cartesian mode
3. Find size of image and set scale appropriately
4. Create axis
5. Create image using low-level image command (setting Color Data to the array that we read with imread Ex: hPimage = image('CData', Perry);)
6. Place image on axis by:
	- setting Parent property to handle of axes object
	- set XData and YData properties to lower left and upper right corner coordinates

axis image	- equal number of pixels on x as well as y axis (fixes distortion of image displayed in Matlab)


% placeAgentP
%	import image of Perry the Platypus and place it on an axis

clear;
clc
clf;

%% import figure

Perry = imread('Perry_the_Platypus.png');

%% find image scale
[ny, nx, nz] = size(Perry);	- [row, column, plane]
PerryWidth = 4;			-image width	
PerryHeight = PerryWidth* (ny/nx);	-scales width with height so image is proportionate

%% flip color plane
for k = 1:3				-Image data is stored where the row number increases going down the y-axis, so we must flip the image
	Perry(:, :, k) = flipud(Perry(:, :, k));	-Goes through red, green, and blue color plans 
end					-Flips upside down - makes lowest row the highest row and vice versa
		
		
	
%% create axes

axes xy			-creates normal Cartesian axis as opposed to an image axis (so direction will be in the right way)
axes equal		-makes pixels in up-right-left-down direction the same
axis([0, 15, 0, 10]);
hax = gca;		-placement for the handle that will get the current axis 

%% create figure and place on axis

hPimage = image('CData', Perry);	-creates image object from the Color Data that is in the array 'Perry'
hPimage.Parent = hax;	

%% set coordinates of lower left and upper right corners

xLL = 7;					-Now we can change this without changing scale of image
yLL = 0.5;
xUr = xLL + PerryWidth;
yUr = yLL + PerryHeight;			-Now image is scaled appropriately

hPimage.XData = [xLL, xUR];				
hPimage.YData = [yLL, yUR];	
	
         -Sets X and Y coordinates of two points

	Ex: 
	
	hPimage.XData = [3, 10];	-But this can distort image if the image is not scaled appropriately (this is why we get the size of the image)
	hPimage.YData = [1, 5];
	(3, 1) => lower left corner of image
	(10, 5) => upper right corner of image

	hPimage.XData = [xLL, xUR];
	hPimage.YData = [yLL, yUR];
