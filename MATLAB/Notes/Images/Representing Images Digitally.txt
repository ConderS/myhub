--------Digital Representation of Images-----------

We can use Matlab 8-bit binary to represent light. 0 being black, and 255 being completely white. 
(8-bit unsigned integers --> 255 is maximum numerical representation)

Color of a gray sphere: represented by a bunch of digits ranging from 0 to 255

Can represent color using three 8-bit integers (Three 0 to 255 scales. For Red, Green, and Blue - RGB)

--in Matlab---

rects = imread('Rectangles.png')	- Reads image into matlab and stores it into 'rects' variable

image(rects)			- Matlab displays image stored in 'rects'

rects(:, :, 1) -Plane containing red rectangle
rects(:, :, 2) -Plane containing green recetangle	-Displays the matrix of numbers 0-255 of brightness
rects(:, :, 3) -Plane containing blue rectangle

	-An RGB image is stored in matrix of size Nrow x Ncol x 3
		-Each sheet (1,2,3) represents a color component
