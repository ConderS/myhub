-----------Transparency-------------

Some files contain a 4th layer with information on the transparency of the image.
	[rects, mode, Ralpha] = imrea('Rectangles.png');
		-mode plays no role in this process here but we must request it for syntax purposes

--------------

[rects, map, Ralpha] = imread['Recetangles.png'];

	-Ralpha contains information about what areas we'd like to be transparent and opaque
		-the rectangles area is white. the black background is black

image(rects, 'AlphaData', Ralpa)
axis image;
axis off		-Turning off axis reveals the true image, -leaves just the background and foreground of the image

	- The background of the image is now gone - transparent 

--------------

High alpha => not transparent

Low alpha => fully transparent

There can also be partial transparencies

AlphaData can be integers (as here) or a double (number) between 0 and 1

Along with the Red, Green, and Blue layer is also the Alpha layer, that determines transparency

------With the Perry code----------

Instead of:

	 Perry = imread('Perry_the_Platypus.png')

We do:

	[Perry, map, Palpha] = imread('Perry_the_Platypus.png');

.....


%% flip color planes
	
for k = 1:3
...
end

Palpha = flipud(Palpha);	-Remember to also flip the alpha plane if we are doing Cartesian axis
	
....

hPimage = image('CData', Perry, 'AlphaData', Palpha);

...

axis off
