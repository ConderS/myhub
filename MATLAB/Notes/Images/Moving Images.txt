-----Moving Image---------

Just need to change the axis position, don't have to reimport and redisplay the image each time

---From Perry code----

%% move agent p 
%	shifts x coordinate from right to left

xinit = 15;
xfin = -15;
Nx = 400;
x = linspace(xinit, xfin, Nx);

axis off

for ix = 1:Nx
	xLL = x(ix);
	xUR = xLL + PerryWidth;

	him.XData = [xLL, xUR];

	drawnow
end
