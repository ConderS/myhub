----Variables Names-----

- Names are made up of LETTERS and DIGITS

- The FIRST character MUST be a LETTER

- Underscore, "_" counts as a letter
	- Don't begin variable names with underscore though, library routines usually use those

- Case-sensitive: Upper and lower case letters are distinct. 
	- Variables names: lower case 
	- Symbolic constants: upper case


- We tend to use SHORT names for local variables, (especialyl loop indices),
	and LONGER names for EXTERNAL variables
