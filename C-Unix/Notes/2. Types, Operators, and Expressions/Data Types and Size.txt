char	- a single byte, capable of holding ONE character in the local character set

int	- integer, arbitrary (depends on the natural size of integers on the host machine)

float	- single-precision floating point

double 	- double-precision floating point


-----------------------------

We can also apply qualifiers to these basic types:

	short int some_variable;

	long int counter;

	long double;


The word 'int' is typically omitted in such declarations, and it usually is


short	- usually 16 bits - 2 bytes	(at least)

long	- 32 bits	- 4 bytes		(at least)

int	- either 16 or 32 bits	(at least longer than 'short', and shorter than 'long')

'float, double, long double' are also dependent on the machine's implementation of them

------

The qualifier 'signed' or 'unsigned' may be applied to 'char' or any integer

The unsigned numbers are always positive or 0, obeying the arithmetic modulo 2^n (where 'n' is the # of bits in the type)

	For 'chars':
		unsigned char	- Values between 0 and 255
		signed char	From  -128 to 127 (2^n / 2 to 2^n - 1)
					- In a TWO'S COMPLEMENT MACHINE

Whether plain 'chars' are signed or unsigned is dependent upon the machine.
	- However, PRINTABLE characters are always positive.
