- All variables must be declared before use. 

- Can declare multiple of the same type at once.

	int lower, upper, step;

	char c, line[1000];

- Do not 'tentatively' define the variables like this for global variables.


----------Automatic Variables----------

Automatic variables are those declared inside a function or a block - those with LOCAL scope.
	- Initialized each time the function or block is called. 


-----------Const---------

const	- specifies that the value of the variable will not be changed.
	
	const double e = 2.718...;
	
- Can be used with array arguments, indicating that the function does not change that array

	int strlen(const char[]);

- If the program attempts to change the 'const' variable, the result of the action is IMPLEMENTATION-DEFINED
