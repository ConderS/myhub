- They all have the same precedence.

- Just below them in precedence are the equality operators: 	==     !=

&& and || 

- Expressions connected by && and || are evaluted left to right.
- Evaluation stops as soon as the truth or falsehood of the result is known. 

- && has HIGHER precedence than ||

	- Both are LOWER than the relational operators above.

for ( i = 0; i < lim-1 && (c= getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF; ++i)
	s[i] = c;

- Pay attention to the order of these tests.
	1. Check for room in array 's' (i < lim-1)
	2. Get char 'c' first, then test it against EOF
