#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
	printf("hello, world\n");
}

Output: 
	hello, world


------

#include <stdio.h>

	Tells compiler to include information about the standard input/output library
	NOT IMPORT

	Puts the contents of that file in that line. Substitutes that line with all of the file 'stdio.h''s code

main() {...}	

	Define a function named "main" that receives no argument values.
	Statements of main() are enclosed in braces

\n
	Newline character. Use it to advance to the next line after the output is printed.
	Also called an "escape sequence"

------Compiling and Running-------


To compile and run in UNIX:
	
	Create file name that ends with ".c"
	
Compile:		cc hello.c
	
	This will make an executable file called "a.out"

Run:		./a.out

	This will run 'a.out' and print: hello, world	


This is different depending on the system.


-------main()-----------

The program begins executing at the beginning of main()

	Every program must there have a main() somewhere


--------------------------

ll	- ls

cat hello.c	- Prints contents of code into terminal

which hello.c	- Shows directory address of the command/program hello.c

		- Each command has a location it's coming from. You tell the terminal where to find the command to run it

.		- One dot = Current directory

..		- Upstairs directory

-------------

1. Compilation

2. Linking

gcc hello.c -o hello		- Ouputs the name of file "hello.c" into "hello"

gcc main.o myadd.o -o myadd
		
			- An executable has no extensions
			- Running 'myadd' runs both 'main.o' and 'myadd.o'

gcc -c hello.c	- Compile hello.c only

gcc hello.c	- Linking with hello.o into an executable

hello.o 		- the Compiled version of hello.c


gcc -c Wall main.c		- Enables warning when compiling

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


----#include----

#include "myadd.h"

	Include the code of the file present in the current directory
