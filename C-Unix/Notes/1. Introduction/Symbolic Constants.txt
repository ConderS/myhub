Give meaningful names to magic numbers, etc..

#define	name	replacement text

Any occurence of "name" will be replaced by the corresponding replacement text.

Name has the same form as a variable name.

The replacement text can be any sequence of characters, not limited to numbers. 


#include <stdio.h>

#define LOWER 0 		/* Notice lack of semicolons */
#define UPPER 300
#define STEP 20

main()
{
	int fahr;

	for (fahr = LOWER; fahr <= UPPER; fahr = fahr + STEP) 
		printf("%3d %6.1f\n", fahr, (5.0/9.0) * (fahr-32));
}

These names represent symbolic constants NOT variables. Mere representations of the LITERAL 0, or 300, etc..
