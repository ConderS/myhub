Text stream	- sequence of charactes divided into lines
		- Each line consists of 0 or more characters followed by a newline character


-----char------

getchar()		- reads next input character (by KEYBOARD) and returns it as a value

Ex:
	c = getchar()	- 'c' contains next character of input


putchar(c)		- Prints contents of variable 'c' as a character (on to the screen)


-----------File Copying--------------


#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
	int c;
	
	c = getchar();

	while (c != EOF) {
		putchar(c);
		c = getchar();
	}
}


'getchar' returns a EOF, "end of file", when there is no more input.


!!NOTE:	We can't initialize 'c' as "char" because it must be big enough to hold EOF in addition to any possible char.
	Therefore we use 'int'.

EOF is defined in <stdio.h>.

By using the symbolic constant, we make sure that NOTHING in the program depends on that SPECIFIC numeral value.



NOTE::
	while( (c = getchar()) != EOF)

This is better, HOWEVER, we MUST put PARENTHESES around 'c=getchar()'.

	Otherwise it will do 'c = ( getchar() != EOF) ' and set 'c' to 0 or 1. 

-------------------------

++nc;
	
	Increment 'nc' by one. 
	nc++ is also a thing, but use ++nc for some reason.
