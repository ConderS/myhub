Goto is never necessary.

In practice, it is ALMOST ALWAYS easy to write code without it.

Goto is not even used in the textbook.

-----goto-----

The most common method is to abandon processing in some DEEPLY NESTED structure 
	- Like breaking out of two or more loops at once.
		The break statement cannot be used directly since it only exits from the innermost loop. 

Ex:
	for (...)
		for (...)
		...
		if (disaster)
			goto error;

	error:
		clean up the mess


Label		- Same form as a variable name, and is followed by a colon. 
		- Can be attached to any statement in the same function as the goto
		- The scope of the label is the ENTIRE function


Code involving a goto can always be written without one.
