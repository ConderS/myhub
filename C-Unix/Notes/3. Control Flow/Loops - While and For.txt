Any of the three parts can omitted, but the semicolons must remain

	for (;;) {
		...
	}

This is an infinite loop that would require BREAK or RETURN to exit
	(can also use while)


-------------Semicolon in Body------------

int i;

for (...) {
	;
}

For loop proceeds normally, but no action is taken even if true.
	
	- Used to increment variables inside the expression space of the for loop.
		(Like skipping over certain array indexes if a certain condition is true)

	- In this case, you'd probably initialize 'i' OUTSIDE of the for loop, so that once it has been increased to
		some value, you can USE it in OTHER statements

	- !!Regular practice in C: 
		Initialize 'i' OUTSIDE of for loop
		Only "LESS THAN" <, NOT '<='
		'i' is initialized to 0

	Ex:
		int i;
		for( i = 0; i < 10; i++)
			printf("%d", i + 1);


------------While------------------

Proper practice for 'while' loops.


int i = 0;
while( i < 10) {
	...
	..
	..
	i++;
}


-----Comma--------------

- Allows multiple expressions. Use this SPARINGLY. Only when constructs are STRONGLY related to each other. 

Ex:

int c, i , j;

for (i = 0, j = strlen(s) - 1; i < j; i++, j--) {
	c = s[i];
	s[i] = s[j];
	s[j] = c;
}
