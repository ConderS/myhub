switch (expression) {
	case const-expr: statements
	...
	default: statements
}


- 'default' is executed if none of the other cases are satisfied 
	- Optional: if it isn't there and none of the cases match, then nothing happens

	- Cases and the default clause can occur in ANY ORDER

- Can include multiple cases for one statement:
	
	Ex:
		case '0': case '1': case '2': ..... case '9':
			ndigit[c - '0'];
			break;
		case ' ':
		case '\n':
			nwhite++;
			break;
		...


-------break-----------

The break statements causes an IMMEDIATE EXIT from the 'switch'

	- 'Break' and 'return are the most common ways to leave a 'switch'

- Break can also be used to exit 'while', 'for', and 'do' loops

- Put 'break' after the LAST CASE (sometimes the 'default') even though it's logically unnecessary. 

	- Protects code when another case gets added at the end some day
	- Defensive programming.
