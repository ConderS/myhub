Things become 'statements' when followed by a semicolon.

	x = 0;
	i++;
	printf(...);		- clarification: this is a function prototype

Braces { } are used to group declarations and statements together into a COMPOUND STATEMENT, or BLOCK. 

There is no semicolon after the RIGHT brace that ends a block. 

	Ex: printf(...){....}


-----------Scope----------------

{
	int x = 0;

	{
		int x = 1;
		printf("%d", x);
	}
	
	printf("%d", x);
}


- 'x' is an Automatic, Local, and Stack variable

- The 'x' declared ONLY exists within the two braces it is declared in. 

	x = 0 exists throughout the entire function, but is replaced by the second 'x'.

	Outside of the inner block, the 'x' with value 0 is printed.
