If the program is within MULTIPLE DIFFERENT files: 
	we'd need to CENTRALIZE the global defintiions and declarations shared among the files.

Header file:	Where all the global definitions and declarations are stored (save it in '.h')

	Ex: 'calc.h' for all the push, pop, getop, getch, ungetch methods


Then... in ALL of the other files, we include at the top:

	#include "calc.h"

	(Notice the quotation marks in respect to the arrows '<>' that we use to include standard libraries)
