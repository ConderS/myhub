C does not allow functions to be defined inside other functions.

By default, external variables and functions have the property that all references to them by the same name 
	(even from those compiled separately)
	are references to the same thing. 

	- Property is called "external linkage"

- Because external variables are GLOBALLY ACCESSIBLE, they provide an alternative to function arguments 
	and return values for communicating data BETWEEN FUNCTIONS

	- Any function may access an external variable by referring to it by name
		AS LONG AS it has been DECLARED somehow (separately within the function?)

- External variables are permanent	 - retain values from one function invocation to the next
	

- A variable is external if it is defined OUTSIDE of ANY function
