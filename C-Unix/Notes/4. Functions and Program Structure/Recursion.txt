When a function calls itself recursively, each invocation gets a fresh set of all the automatic variables, 
	INDEPENDENT of the previous set.

	(Normal recursion)


- Recursion may provide no saving in storage (somewhere a STACK of values is being processed and maintained)
	NOR will it be faster
	
	- But it's more compat, and much easier to write and understand than the non-recursive equivalent

- Useful for data structures
