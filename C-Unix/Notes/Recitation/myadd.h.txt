#ifndef _MYADD_H__

	A header guard.
	
	If myadd.h is not defined, define it, and then close it with "#endif"	- Only executed if  a pre-processor
		variable is NOT DEFINED

	This ensures that "myadd.h" is only included ONCE in an executable.

		The underscores are simply naming conventions.


int add(int a, int b);

	Prototype.

	That's all you want in a header file.

	A blueprint for all the functions you're going to have.   


The header file will catch mistakes you make in other files when you're writing the function DIFFERENTLY than the 
	prototype.

If you change one "myadd" function, the header file will remind you to change the "myadd" functions of all your OTHER
	files, provided you "include" the header file in every one of those programs.
