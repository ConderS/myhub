Relative paths don't have the slash in front.
	Relative to current directory.

Absolute paths show the whole path to the file/directory from the ROOT.

Files starting with a dot are HIDDEN FILES


If you don't include "-o" when you link the files, you get the generic "a.out"
	
	"-o" is purely for naming the file that is outputted.
