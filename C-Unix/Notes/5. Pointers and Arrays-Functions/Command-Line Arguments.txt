echo		- Echoes its command-line arguments on a single line

----------Arguments------

When 'main' is called, it has TWO arguments:

	First (argc, argument count):
		Number of command-line arguments the program was invoked with

	Second (argv, argument vector):
		Pointer to an array of character strings that contain the arguments
		ONE per string

----

echo hello, world

PRINTS:

hello, world


Convention:
		argv[0]	- name by which the program was invoked 
			- 'argc' is thus AT LEAST one.
			If 'argc' is 1, there are no command-line arugments after the program name.


Above, 'argc' is 3. 

	argv[0], argv[1], argv[2]
	"echo" "hello,"  "world"

--The first optional argument is 'argv[1]' and the last is 'argv[argc-1]'

Standard requires that 'argv[argc]' be a NULL pointer


Incrementing ++argv moves it along to the next argument

	'*argv 'is then the pointer to that argument

In the code for 'echo':

NOTE:	'argc' is DECREMENTED when 'argv' is INCREMENTED

	When 'argc' is decremented, and becomes ZERO, there are no arguments left to print.

-----------------

Optional arguments should be permitted in ANY order

	And the REST of the program should be INDEPENDENT of the number of arguments that were present

It is also convenient for users if OPTIONAL arguments can be COMBINED

------

In 'getline' program:
	
	(*++argv)[0] is the first character of the agument string

	NOTE:
		' *++argv[0] ' would be taken as ' *++(argv[0]) '
