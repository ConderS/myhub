Since pointers are variables THEMSELVES,
	they can be STORED in ARRAYS just as other variables can. 


Ex:	We want to sort a set of text lines into alphabetic order
	These text lines can be of DIFFERENT length

	To cope efficiently/conveniently with variable-lenght text lines:	
		We use an Array of Pointers

	The pointers themselves can be stored in an array, and two lines can be compared by passing their pointers
		to 'strcmp'
	
	The lines themselves are stored end-to-end in ONE long character array

	When two out of order lines have to be exchanged, the pointers themselves are exchanged. 



Take a look at the big program code if needed. More on pointers.
